    h2 Review
    p
      | Orwell's portrayal of a surveillance state and the suppression of truth is both chilling and thought-provoking. The novel explores themes of power, language, propaganda, and the consequences of unchecked authority.

    p
      | The bleak and oppressive atmosphere of the society is expertly conveyed through the prose. Orwell's predictions about technology's role in surveillance and manipulation have proven remarkably prescient, making the novel even more relevant in today's digital age.
